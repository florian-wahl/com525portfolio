Franck West is a 28 years old and lives alone in his loft in Hyde Park, Chicago. His profession is best described as a day trader/entrepreneur who works from home. He has an active regime whereas he wakes up early in the morning to trade stocks, reads the news, and does a little research on up and coming companies and markets. After he finishes his work, his afternoons usually are taken up by rock climbing or boxing to relieve some stress. Franck always feels like he needs to be experiencing something new, as so, he enjoys a wide range of dishes and is always on the lookout for new tastes. Where he lives there is not a good selection of options as far as diversity of cuisines, when it comes to restaurants. GrubHub is his go to option for ordering food in different neighborhoods from Chicago. Once the evening rolls around and he has got his work and personal affairs out of the way, he likes to enjoy himself by indulging in an exotic cuisine. He begins by searching through restaurants for food through GrubHub on his phone.
