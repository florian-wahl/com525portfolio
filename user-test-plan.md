### Participation introduction & consent:

Hi, everyone!  My name is [_name_], and this is [_other person present_], they will be responsible for the recordings during this trial.

We would like to remind you this is not a test based on your individual skills, rather than a trail on the application at hand. With that in mind, when you are answering questions please try to think aloud and talk us through what you may normally do given the situation. Say what you&#39;re looking at, what you&#39;re trying to do, and what you&#39;re thinking. There are no criteria for your answer, and you don&#39;t need to worry about whether your answers or behaviors are right or wrong, just interpret the question, and take your time to respond and react. If you struggle with using or understanding the application, your feedback is valuable for us to make helpful changes to improve this application.

The session should take about an hour. If you need a break, just let me know at any point. If you have any questions during the session, feel free to ask them. I may not answer you immediately since we are acting mainly as observers, where we are interested in how people will react and solve the issue when nobody is sitting next to them to help, but if your issue puts a hindrance on the trail we will answer your question promptly.

We would like at this time to make you aware that what you say and do will be recorded strictly for our observations only. These recordings will not be used for any other purposes beyond this particular trial. [Hand over consent form]

Thank you for agreeing to participate in our research study today. We&#39;re working on the design for the mobile application GrubHub, and during the session, we&#39;ll ask you several specific questions to test which elements or functions could further be improved upon.

### Explain any equipment:

Our test device is an iPhone 6, and it will be put in front of you before we begin the trail. GrubHub is an online and mobile food-ordering application, and it has been already been pre-installed onto the testing device. We will ask you to use the GrubHub application yourself in the session.

### Pre-questions:

- Do you have any questions so far?

OK. Before we look at the application, I&#39;d like to ask you just a few quick questions.

- First, what is your occupation? Could you summarize an average day for you?
- How much time do you typically spend using your smartphone, in specifics to web browsing, and other applications, besides texting and social media?
- What would be the split between web browsing and using applications? A rough estimate percentage wise?
- What type of applications do you use most frequently?
- Do you have any favorite mobile applications?

OK, great. We&#39;re done with the questions and we can start introducing our tasks.

### Introduce tasks:

We have all together 7 tasks, and I&#39;ll give them to you one at a time.

Please think aloud as you work and I may prompt you to ask what you are thinking during the session. Once you are stuck and have attempted to fix the problem yourself, please tell us if you cannot continue without aid.

Do you have any questions before we begin?

[_Task #1_]
We will begin our first task now.

[_Present participant with the first task. Read it aloud also._]

[_When complete._] Thank you. We&#39;ll now move to the next task.

[_Task #7_]
This is our last task.

### Task completion and questionnaire:

Thank you. We have completed all tasks.

I have a brief questionnaire here that I&#39;d like you to complete. The information you provide is for our use only. Your name is not stored with the questionnaire data.

### Debrief:

Once again, I&#39;d like to say thanks for coming today. Your efforts help us to improve the GrubHub application.

Do you have any questions or comments for our test now that we&#39;re done?

## <span id="5">5. Tasks List</span>
